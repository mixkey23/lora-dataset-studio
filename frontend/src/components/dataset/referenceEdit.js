/* Reference-photo editing: which engines can edit, what the default pick is, and
   the small guards the modal relies on. PURE JS (no JSX) so node --test can
   import and exercise it directly — same split as engineSelection.js.

   The ✦ Edit modal sends the reference + a prompt to an engine and gets an edited
   candidate back. It used to be an API-only gesture, because the edit was a
   BLOCKING provider call and the local engines have no blocking call to make.
   That is no longer true: a local edit is queued on the same ComfyUI job queue as
   every other local render and answered by its completion callback, so the whole
   engine set can edit — and the two free ones now cover the most exploratory
   gesture in the app, the one you repeat until it looks right. */
