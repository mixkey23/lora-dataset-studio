"""Shared failure taxonomy for the three API image engines.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The OpenRouter engine shipped with a rule the two older engines did not follow:
every failure RAISES with a named cause, and the causes that would repeat
identically on every remaining row of a batch stop the run instead of paying for
the same refusal once per image. Nano Banana and ChatGPT swallowed everything
into `return None`, which the fan-out words as "empty response (often a
content-policy refusal)" — the wrong sentence for a rejected key, an unknown
model, or a model that cannot take reference images at all.

Making the engine model user-editable is what forced the alignment: a typo'd or
text-only model slug is now a routine, self-inflicted, fixable mistake, and it
must say so instead of sending the user to rewrite a prompt.

TWO LEVELS, ONE MEANING EACH
----------------------------
`EngineError`  — this image failed, for a named reason. The batch continues
                 (rate limit, provider hiccup, one refused request).
`EngineFatal`  — every remaining row would fail for the exact same reason (no
                 key, key rejected, no credits/quota, unknown or unusable
                 model). The fan-out stops the run on the first one.

`None` keeps ONE meaning across all three engines: the provider answered 200 and
produced no image, i.e. a content-policy refusal.

The per-engine subclasses below stay so a caller (and a test) can still name the
provider it is talking to; the fan-out catches only the two base classes.
No message in this hierarchy ever carries an API key or a fragment of one.
