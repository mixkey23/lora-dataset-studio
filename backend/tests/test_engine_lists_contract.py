"""The engine list exists in TWO languages — this file is the seam that holds
them together.

WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
--------------------
Python owns `svc.API_ENGINES` (what /ref/edit and the fan-out accept) and
JavaScript owns `API_ENGINES` in engineSelection.js (what the workspace offers).
Neither can import the other, so the only thing that can stop them drifting is a
test that reads both. Drift is not theoretical: OpenRouter shipped as a
generation engine while the ✦ Edit modal and the /ref/edit route each kept their
own two-engine copy, so the app offered an engine set that no longer matched what
the server accepted.

The rule the codebase now follows is DERIVE, don't copy: the edit engines are the
API engines on both sides (`EDIT_ENGINES = [...API_ENGINES]` in JS,
`svc.API_ENGINES` in the route). That kills the third and fourth copies. This
test kills the drift between the two that remain — ids AND human labels, because
the labels word user-facing refusals on both sides.

Parsing JS with a regex is crude, and deliberately so: it must fail loudly if the
declaration moves or changes shape, rather than quietly matching nothing.
